ccNoise
=======

ccNoise is a lightweight coherent noise library, which can be used to render and combine:
- White noise
- Value noise
- Worley noise
- Perlin noise

The following libraries are required to build ccNoise:
- [ccRandom](https://github.com/jobtalle/ccRandom)
- [ccTrigonometry](https://github.com/jobtalle/ccTrigonometry)

Examples:

![Worley noise with n=1](examples/worley1.jpg)
![Perlin, value and worley noise combined](examples/composite1.jpg)
![Worley noise with n=1 and manhattan distance](examples/worley2.png)
![Fractal perlin noise](examples/perlin1.jpg)
![Value noise with cubic interpolation](examples/value1.png)
